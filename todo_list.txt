Start with:

    Guides don't build. (Look @ Rails 3)

Open Issues
===========
* Make bcms a thor gem. Convert from application templates to CLI.
* Can we/should we convert the guides to Github wiki pages? Might be less work to maintain, along with more flexibility. Keep old URLs/redirect them.

Gems to Publish (once its live)
============
bcms_fckeditor  - 1.1.0 is pushed to github. Gem needs to be pushed as well. Need to test file upload (browser.xml) from within the browser
bcms_news - 1.2 pushed to github. Gem not released yet. (Has bugs)
* BUG - Recent Archive portlet is throwing errors.
bcms_google_mini_search - 1.2 pushed to github. Gem not released.

Future Things to do
===============
* Review integration tests to determine where 'error_messages_on' deprecation is coming from.
* Having to explicitly add migrations files to module installers is somewhat tedious and error prone. (Might not be a big deal though)
* Add Block.publish and publish! for easier coding.
* Move 'datepicker' initialization into application.js
* Upgrade jquery.selectbox-0.5 to jquery.sb.js (https://github.com/revsystems/jQuery-SelectBox). This will likely improve the usability of the selectbox.
* Reduce need to developers to modify content-like files on server (CSS, JS, Images, Templates)
** Confirm w/ developers on what is commonly touched.
** Step 1: Make templates start on file system, appear in UI and then be 'forked' in UI. Avoids need to 'copy' into CMS and delete.
** Look at WebDAV / HTTPS protocol.
* What is the difference between application template and profiles?
* Clean up all 'old' initialization code (add_cms_routes_method, add to rails path, etc)
* Merge all existing migrations into core as well as seeds.rb. Rework how seeds gets run as part of the project. (Future proof this).
* Rename to cms:new rather than browser_cms:cms
* Generators: These appear to be almost identical to how application templates worked. We should probably rewrite app templates to use new generators instead.
* Namespace core files (especially users) to better support dropping in as project.
* Allow Content Blocks to be namespaced.
* Clean up logging messages that are filling up the production logs unnecessarily
** 'Caching enabled'
** 'Not the CMS site'
** 'Rendering content block X'
** 'Not caching, user logged in'
** Rendering template X'
* Have at most one line per request for any diagnostic result.
* Fix broken tests to make it work under 1.8.7/RubyEE
* test/dummy has some duplication ( migrations, seed.rb). This can probably be removed now anyway, due to how Gemfile->gemspec works.
* html_safe = duplication:  Every content_block's render.html.erb needs to stick html_safe on everything, which is both tedious and annoying. Need to figure out a better way to globally handle this.
