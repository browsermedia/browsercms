= Better nested set

This plugin provides an enhanced acts_as_nested_set mixin for ActiveRecord, the 
object-relational mapping layer of the framework Ruby on Rails. The original 
nested set in Rails lacks many important features, such as moving branches within a tree.

= Installation

  script/plugin install svn://rubyforge.org/var/svn/betternestedset/trunk

== Details

A nested set is a smart way to implement an _ordered_ tree that allows for
fast, non-recursive queries. For example, you can fetch all descendants of 
a node in a single query, no matter how deep the tree. The drawback is that 
insertions/moves/deletes require complex SQL, but that is handled behind 
the curtains by this plugin!

Nested sets are appropriate for ordered trees 
(e.g. menus, commercial categories) and big trees that must be queried 
efficiently (e.g. threaded posts).

See http://www.dbmsmag.com/9603d06.html for nested sets theory, and a tutorial here:
http://threebit.net/tutorials/nestedset/tutorial1.html

== Small nested set theory reminder

An easy way to visualize how a nested set works is to think of a parent entity surrounding all
of its children, and its parent surrounding it, etc. So this tree:
  root
    |_ Child 1
      |_ Child 1.1
      |_ Child 1.2
    |_ Child 2
      |_ Child 2.1
      |_ Child 2.2

Could be visualized like this:
    ___________________________________________________________________
   |  Root                                                             |
   |    ____________________________    ____________________________   |
   |   |  Child 1                  |   |  Child 2                  |   |
   |   |   __________   _________  |   |   __________   _________  |   |
   |   |  |  C 1.1  |  |  C 1.2 |  |   |  |  C 2.1  |  |  C 2.2 |  |   |
   1   2  3_________4  5________6  7   8  9_________10 11_______12 13  14
   |   |___________________________|   |___________________________|   |
   |___________________________________________________________________| 

The numbers represent the left and right boundaries.  The table then might
look like this:
   id | parent_id | lft  | rgt  | data
    1 |           |    1 |   14 | root
    2 |         1 |    2 |    7 | Child 1
    3 |         2 |    3 |    4 | Child 1.1
    4 |         2 |    5 |    6 | Child 1.2
    5 |         1 |    8 |   13 | Child 2
    6 |         5 |    9 |   10 | Child 2.1
    7 |         5 |   11 |   12 | Child 2.2

To get all children of an entry +parent+, you
    SELECT * WHERE lft IS BETWEEN parent.lft AND parent.rgt

To get the number of children, it's 
    (right - left - 1)/2

To get a node and all its ancestors going back to the root, you
    SELECT * WHERE node.lft IS BETWEEN lft AND rgt

As you can see, queries that would be recursive and prohibitively slow on ordinary trees are suddenly quite fast. Nifty, isn't it? There are instance methods for each of the above, plus many others.


= API
Method names are mostly the same as in acts_as_tree, to make replacment from one 
by another easier, except for object creation:

in acts_as_tree:

  my_item.children.create(:name => "child1")

in acts_as_nested_set:

  # adds a new item at the "end" of the tree, i.e. with child.left = max(tree.right) + 1
  child = MyClass.create(:name => "child1")
  # now move the item to its desired location
  child.move_to_child_of my_item

You can use:
* <tt>move_to_child_of</tt>
* <tt>move_to_right_of</tt>
* <tt>move_to_left_of</tt>
and pass them an id or an object.

Other instance methods added by this plugin include:
* <tt>root</tt> - root item of the tree (the one that has a nil parent)
* <tt>roots</tt> - root items, in case of multiple roots (the ones that have a nil parent)
* <tt>level</tt> - number indicating the level, a root being level 0
* <tt>ancestors</tt> - array of all parents, with root as first item
* <tt>self_and_ancestors</tt> - array of all parents and self
* <tt>siblings</tt> - array of all siblings (items sharing the same parent)
* <tt>self_and_siblings</tt> - array of itself and all siblings
* <tt>children_count</tt> - count of all direct children
* <tt>children</tt> - array of all immediate children
* <tt>all_children</tt> - array of all children and nested children
* <tt>all_children_count</tt> - count of all nested children
* <tt>full_set</tt> - array of itself and all children and nested children
* <tt>leaves</tt> - array of the children of this node who do not have children
* <tt>leaves_count</tt> - the number of leaves
* <tt>check_subtree</tt> - check the left/right indexes of this node and all descendants
* <tt>check_full_tree</tt> - check the whole tree this node belongs to
* <tt>renumber_full_tree</tt> - recreate the left/right indexes for the whole tree

These should not be of interest, unless you want to write schema-independent SQL:
* <tt>left_col_name</tt> - name of the left column passed on the declaration line
* <tt>right_col_name</tt> - name of the right column passed on the declaration line    
* <tt>parent_col_name</tt> - name of the parent column passed on the declaration line

Please see the generated RDoc files in doc/ for the full API (run 'rake rdoc' if they need to be created).

== Concurrency and callbacks

ActiveRecord does not yet provide a way to treat columns as read-only, which causes problems for 
nested sets and other things (http://dev.rubyonrails.org/ticket/6896). As a workaround, we have overridden 
ActiveRecord::Base#update to prevent it from writing to the left/right columns. This protects the left/right 
values from corruption under concurrent usage, but it breaks the update-related callbacks (before_update and friends).
If you need the callbacks and aren't worried about concurrency, you can comment out the update method and the two
methods below it (all at the very bottom of better_nested_set.rb).

If this situation bugs you as much as it does us, leave a comment on the above ticket asking the core team to
please apply the patch soon.


== Scopes and roots

Scope separates trees from each other, and roots are nodes without a parent. The complication is that a tree can 
have multiple ("virtual") roots.

Virtual roots?! In some situations, such as a menu, the root of the tree is ignored, and becomes a nuisance to the programmer.
In that case it makes sense to remove the root, turning each of its children into a 'virtual root'. These virtual roots 
are still members of the same tree, sharing a single continuous left/right index.

Here's an example that demonstrates scopes, roots and virtual roots:
  class Set < ActiveRecord::Base
    acts_as_nested_set :scope => :tree_id
  end

  # This will create two trees, each with a single (real) root.
  a = Set.create(:tree_id => 1)
  b = Set.create(:tree_id => 2)

  # This will add a second root to tree #2, so it will have two (virtual) roots.
  # New objects are by default created as virtual roots at the right side of the tree.
  c = Set.create(:tree_id => 2)  # c.lft is 3, c.rgt is 4 -- the lft/rgt values are contiguous between the two roots

  # When we move c to be a child of b, tree #2 will have a single (real) root again. 
  c.move_to_child_of(b)

  # The table would now look like this:
  id | parent_id | tree_id | lft | rgt | data
   1 |      NULL |       1 |   1 |   2 | a
   2 |      NULL |       2 |   1 |   4 | b
   3 |         2 |       2 |   2 |   3 | c
     
== Recommendations

Don't name your left and right columns 'left' and 'right', since most databases reserve these words.
Use something like 'lft' and 'rgt' instead.

If you have a choice between multiple separate trees or one large tree with multiple roots, separate trees will 
offer better performance when altering tree structure (inserts/moves/deletes).

= Where to find better_nested_set

This plugin is provided by Jean-Christophe Michel from Symétrie, and the home page is:

  http://opensource.symetrie.com/trac/better_nested_set/
  
= What databases?

The code has so far been tested on MySQL 5, SQLite3 and PostgreSQL 8, but is thought to work on others.
Databases featuring transactions will help protect the left/right indexes from corruption during concurrent usage.

= Compatibility

Future versions of this code will break compatibility with the original acts_as_nested_set, but this version
is intended to be (almost completely) compatible. Differences include:
* New records automatically have their left/right values set to place them at the far right of the tree.
* Very minor changes to the deprecated method #root?.


= Running the unit tests

1) Set up a test database as specified in database.yml. Example for MySQL:

    create database acts_as_nested_set_plugin_test;
    grant all on acts_as_nested_set_plugin_test.* to 'rails'@'localhost' identified by '';

2) The tests must be run with the plugin installed in a Rails project, so do that if you haven't already.

3) Run 'rake test_mysql' (or test_sqlite3 or test_postgresql) in plugins/betternestedset. The default rake task attempts to use 
all three adapters.
