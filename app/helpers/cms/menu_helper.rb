module Cms
  module MenuHelper
    # Renders a menu. There are two options, neither are required:
    # 
    # ==== Options
    # * <tt>:items</tt> - The items which should appear in the menu. This defaults to calling 
    #   menu_items which generates items automatically based on the current page. But you can use 
    #   this option to pass in a custom menu structure.
    # * <tt>:partial</tt> - The partial used to render the menu. By default this is "partials/menu",
    #   which can be customised through the CMS. The partial gets a local variable <tt>items</tt>.
    #
    # ==== Structure of items
    #
    # The items should be an array of hashes, in a tree. Each hash can have the following keys (name
    # and url are required, others are optional):
    # 
    # * <tt>:name</tt> - The name which appears in the menu
    # * <tt>:url</tt> - The URL to link to
    # * <tt>:id</tt> - The id for the menu item
    # * <tt>:selected</tt> - Boolean value to indicate whether the menu item is the current page
    # * <tt>:target</tt> - The target attribute for the link
    # * <tt>:children</tt> - An array of hashes containing the child menu items. This is where the
    #   tree structure comes in.
    #
    # Edge Cases:
    #   If both @page and :items are nil/empty, this will return an empty string. This might happen if used on an CMS
    #   rendered page, where @page isn't set.
    #
    def render_menu(options = {})
      options[:items] ||= menu_items(options)
      return "" unless options[:items]

      options[:partial] ||= "cms/menus/menu"
      options[:id] ||= "menu"
      options[:class] ||= "menu"
      render :partial => options[:partial], :locals => { :items => options[:items], :css_id => options[:id], :css_class => options[:class] }
    end
    
    # This will render generate an array-of-hashes tree structure based on the page, which can be
    # passed to render_menu in order to generate a menu.
    # 
    # With no options passed, it will generate a structure that includes all the child sections of 
    # the root and then it will include the path of decendent sections all the way to the current
    # page.
    # 
    # Hidden pages will not be included, but if the first page in a Section is hidden, it will be
    # used as the URL for that Section. This is commonly done to have a page for a Section and avoid
    # having duplicates in the navigation.
    # 
    # You can change the behavior with the following options, all of these are optional:
    #
    # ==== Options
    # * <tt>:page</tt> - What page should be used as the current page.  If this value is omitted, 
    #   the value in @page will be used.
    # * <tt>:path</tt> - This will be used to look up a section and that section will used to 
    #   generate the menu structure. The current page will still be the value of the page option or
    #   @page. Note that this is the path to a section, not a path to a page.
    # * <tt>:from_top</tt> - How many below levels from the root the tree should start at.  
    #   All sections at this level will be shown.  The default is 0, which means show all
    #   nodes that are direct children of the root
    # * <tt>:depth</tt> - How many levels deep should the tree go, relative to from_top.  
    #   If no value is supplied, the tree will go all the way down to the current page.
    #   If a value is supplied, the tree will be that many levels underneath from_top deep.
    # * <tt>:limit</tt> - Limits the number of top-level elements that will be included in the list
    # * <tt>:show_all_siblings</tt> - Passing true for this option will make all sibilings appear in
    #   the tree. The default is false, in which case only the siblings of nodes within the open
    #   path will appear.
    # 
    # ==== Examples
    #
    # Assume you have the structure the NFL, which is NFL > Conference > Division > Team,
    # with teams being a Page, everything else a Section.  Also, assume we are on the
    # Baltimore Ravens page. If you're not a footbal fan, see http://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/teams
