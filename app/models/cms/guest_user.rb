# Guests are a special user that represents a non-logged in user. The main reason to create an explicit
# instance of this type of user is so that the permissions a Guest user can have can be set via the Admin interface.
#
# Every request that a non-logged in user makes will use this User's permissions to determine what they can/can't do.
