# Allows Rails routes to be matched to CMS pages, allowing arbitrary code that can be executed before the page is rendered.
#
# The primary goal of this is to provide human readable (and cachable) URLs for content_blocks. For example,
# a single 'Article' page can have a portlet that knows how to look up and display an Article by id. By default, this
# would look like this:
#   GET /article?id=120
#
# Unless the Article page is marked a 'cache enabled = false' this will cause problems. Plus that URL is ugly.
# With PageRoutes, you can have multiple URLs all map to the article page, like so:
#   GET /article/2010/12/30/article-1
#   GET /article/2011/1/18/article-2
# In both these cases, these URLs can be matched to a Rails Route which is linked to a page:
# GET /article/:year/:month/:day/:slug -> Articles Page
#
# Saving a new PageRoute will reload the Rails routes.
#
