h2. Creating your own modules

This guide covers how to create and package modules for BrowserCMS. Modules are the primary way to expand the functionality of the BrowserCMS core project.  After reading this guide, you should understand how to:

* Start a new module as project
* Add blocks and portlets
* Add new controllers
* Test your module in another CMS project.

This guide is for BrowserCMS *3.1*. Some code shown here may not work with older versions of BrowserCMS.

h3. Getting Started

The guide is going to walk how a new module can be created from scratch. The goal for our sample module will be to add some store-like functionality to BrowserCMS, and allow editors to create new products and users to browse a product catalog. When we are done, we will

Run the following command to generate a basic BrowserCMS application that is ready to turn into a module.

@bcms bcms_[module name] -m module@

The module template used to create this application will create the following files:

* @.gitignore@

bq. This file prevents files you almost certainly will not want to be added to git to be added to git.

* @public/bcms/[module name]/README@

bq. Explains what this directory is for.  It can safely be deleted.

* @bcms_[module name].gemspec@

bq. Creates a gemspec file in case you want to manage the gemspec by hand.

* @config/initializers/init_module.rb@

bq. Requires the following file.

* @lib/bcms_[module name].rb@

bq. Requires the following file.

* @lib/bcms_[module name]/routes.rb@

bq. Has boilerplate code ready in case you have specific routes the application will need to have available.  For example, if your module has content blocks that will be managed by the CMS administrative interface, routes for the controllers handling this management will need to be added here.

* @rails/init.rb@

bq. Adds the gem root to the rails paths, adds all migration files to the list of files that will be copied into any application using the module when @script/generate browser_cms@ is run, and adds all files in @public/bcms/bcms_[module name]/@ to the list of files that will be copied into any application using the module when @script/generate browser_cms@ is run.

* @LICENSE.txt@

bq. GNU Lesser General Public License

* @COPYRIGHT.txt@

bq. BrowserMedia's copyright text.

* @GPL.txt@

bq. GNU General Public License


Note: the module template was developed primarily for BrowserMedia in-house use.  Therefore the license, copywrite, and gemspec files all reflect our organization.  Please edit and/or remove these files to fit your needs.

h3. Conventions When Building Your Module

Build your module as if you were building a rails application that does whatever you want.

That said, there are some conventions that tend to make things easier.

First, place any files that are used as configuration files for public assects (for example, the fckeditor) in the @public/bcms_config/[module_name]@ directory and have the gem only copy them if they are not already there.  For example you can add code like the following to the @rails/init.rb@ file.

<ruby>
unless File.exists?("#{RAILS_ROOT}/public/bcms_config/fckeditor/fckstyles.xml")
  Cms.add_generator_paths gem_root, "public/bcms_config/fckeditor/fckstyles.xml"  
end
</ruby>

This will make the required configuration file available to the fckeditor, but it won't overwrite it (or even ask you if you want to overwrite it) every time you run @script/generate browser_cms@ for your application.

h3. Testing Your Gem

We strongly encourage the creation of unit, functional, and integration tests as part of your module.

We also suggest that you test your gem against a BrowserCMS application.  To do this, first run 

@bcms module_tester -m demo@ 

wherever (I use @/var/tmp@).  Edit the @config/environment.rb@ file to include the line 

@gem.config 'bcms_[module name]'@

then run the app locally and make sure your module works as expected.
