## Design Integration

Set up Kyle with different manifest style.css file that imports same scss
Form Styles: Write up task for Kyle on doing passive form styling.
Bootstrap 3 - Test after we finish upgrading.

## Tasks

* [BUG] Optimistic locking for pages doesn't work.
* {BUG} Can't add content blocks to pages (javascript insert)
* [REFACTOR] New Page form - Remove all CSS classes from ERB so that new form generation is clean.
* [BUG] Dashboard is not correctly displaying draft pages.

## New Features

* [Feature] Make 'Assign' on Edit page work.
* [Feature] Section Selector: Allow editors to select the section they want to put a page into.

## Design Review

* Errors - Review the placement of errors on the form.
* Google Fonts - Can we include them in the project so it works locally with no internet access.
* On 'Add Page' - Draft should have stronger coloring.
* Selected link for Dropdowns looks off
* User name in small menu isn't flush right with Settings.
* Label/Text is missing left margin. Doesn't stretch to end.
* Inline checkboxes don't left align properly.

## IA Questions

* Where should "Settings" link take user to.
* Preview Pages - What should it do? [It would need to save, then show the form. How is this different than ]
