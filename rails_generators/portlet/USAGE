Description:
    Stubs out a new portlet and its views. Pass the portlet name, either CamelCased or
    under_scored, and an optional list of attribute pairs as arguments.

    Attribute pairs are column_name:sql_type arguments specifying the
    model's attributes. By default, portlets include name:string and template:text
    attributes, so don't specify them.

    This generates a portlet class in app/portlets, a form in app/view/portlets and
    a default view to render the portlet in app/view/portlets, and a unit test in
    test/unit/portlets.
    
    The name you supply will have "portlet" added to it, much the same way controllers work.

Example:
    `./script/generate portlet ListRecentArticles`

        A portlet to find and display a list of recent Article blocks.
            Portlet:            app/portlets/list_recent_articles_portlet.rb
            Form View:          app/views/portlets/list_recent_articles/_form.html.erb
            Default Template:   app/views/portlets/list_recent_articles/render.html.erb
            Unit Test:          test/unit/portlets/list_recent_articles_portlet_test.rb

        The _form.html.erb will have two fields, a text_field for name, and text_area for
        the default template, which will plug in whatever is in render.html.erb.

Example with attributes:
    `./script/generate portlet find_top_x_articles number_to_show:integer description:string`

        A portlet to display a specific number of articles, as specified in the admin UI.
            Portlet:            app/portlets/find_top_x_articles_portlet.rb
            Form View:          app/views/portlets/find_top_x_articles/_form.html.erb
            Default Template:   app/views/portlets/find_top_x_articles/render.html.erb
            Unit Test:          test/unit/portlets/find_top_x_articles_portlet_test.rb

        The _form.html.erb will have text_fields for name, number_to_show and description, as
        well as a text_area for template.
