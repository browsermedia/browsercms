#
# Defines the authentication behavior for controllers in BrowserCMS. It can be added to any controller that needs to 
# hook into the BrowserCMS Authentication behavior like so:
#
# class MySuperSecureController < ApplicationController
#   include Cms::Authentication::Controller
#
# It is based off Restful_Authentication, and adds in behavior to deal with several concepts specific to BrowserCMS.
#
# (Note: 10/8/09 - I was comparing this to a very old version of the generated code from Restful_Authentication,
# so some of the following items may be 'stock' to that. (Especially #2)
#
# 1. Guests - These represents users that are not logged in. What guests can see and do can be modified via the CMS UI. Guests
#             are not considered to be 'logged in'.
# 2. 'Current' User - The currently logged in user is stored in a thread local, and can be accessed anywhere via 'Cms::User.current'.
#             This allows model code to easily record which user is making changes to records, for versioning, etc.
#
# 3. 'Admin' Access Denied Page - If users try to access a protected controller, they are redirected to the CMS administration Login page
#             which may be different than the 'front end' user login page. (Cms::Controller handles that differently)
#
#
# To Dos: It appears as though we are storing the 'current' user in two places, @cms_current_user and Cms::User.current. This is probably not DRY, but
#   more testing would be needed.
#
