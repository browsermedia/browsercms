#
# Can be included into Controllers in your project to allow them to act as though they are CMS pages.
# This means they can be:
#
#   1. Marked as having requiring permission as though they were in a particular section.
#   2. Handle errors thrown from within the methods in the same way that CMS Pages do.
#   3. Use CMS page templates as layouts (like TemplateSupport)
#
# This is intend to replace and deprecate TemplateSupport (which will be supported for a while for backwards compatibility)
#
# Minor Issue:
#   Error handling for Page not found behaves slightly differently than ContentController currently. If the user is logged
#   in as an editor, they will get a 500 page rather than 404. This would require reworking how the error processing
#   works in Cms::ContentRenderingSupport.
